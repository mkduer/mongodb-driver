This was a shot-term proof-of-concept repository for mongoDB using a C# (.NET) driver to connect to Atlas then benchmark cluster performance on AWS vs GCP


Our final project can be found in our [team repository](https://github.com/PieMyth/CloudCluster)


This was a fantastic team project with very diverse working styles. The amount and quality of work achieved was due to the hard work that every individual put into our project, and the results were quite interesting. Our conclusions can be found in our [final paper](https://github.com/PieMyth/CloudCluster/blob/master/Papers/Part%203_%20Query%20Implementation.pdf). You will find that our C# driver was successfully created and we were able to run benchmarks on GCP, AWS, and Azure with quite interesting differences between platforms. More details and insights are available in the paper.
